# devii_python_tutorial

## This tutorial will use Python, Flask, Jinja2, HTML, Javascipt, and a SQL database to create a todo app.

To complete this tutorial start with follwing the instructions here: https://docs-staging.devii.io/docs/Tutorials/python_flask/python_flask_intro

### **Once you have confirmed you have python installed, clone this repository and follow the instructions below**

If you are unsure how to clone a GitHub respository follow the instructions here: https://docs-staging.devii.io/docs/Tutorials/python_flask/python_flask_clone

NEXT,

Create a python virtual environment, this will isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts with other projects.

Run the following command to create a virtual environment named "venv" (OS agnostic):

    python -m venv venv

  or

    python3 -m venv venv

If running Windows run this command to activate your venv:

    venv\Scripts\activate

if running mac or linux run this command to activate your venv:


    source venv/bin/activate

THEN, run

    pip install -r requirements.txt

FINALLY, to run the project

Windows:

    python app.py

Linux:

    flask run

The app should be running on your local server http://127.0.0.1:5000

If you click on the login button and login with your root role (the role used to create your tenant) you will be able to use the app, to have users sign up and usee the app follow the directions here.... (need to add)

## Create Nobody Role, Role Classes and Policy
